# Object Oriented Programming in Python

This lesson provides a brief introduction to the principles of object-oriented
programming in Python. While most of the principles taught are applicable to
all object-oriented languages, some are taught in a way that is more idiomatic
in Python than in other programming languages, and it isn't possible to show
the additional advantages of using object-oriented programming in statically-
typed compiled languages.
